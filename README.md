# Serverless-Web-Application-Development-AWS-
This project is a fully serverless web application built on AWS, designed for taking and managing personal notes. It demonstrates the use of key AWS services such as **Amplify**, **API Gateway**, **Lambda**, **DynamoDB**, and **IAM** to create a secure, scalable, and cost-effective cloud-native application.
